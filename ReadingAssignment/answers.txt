For lab4:

- Book, CompactDisc, DigitalVideoDisc and Disc are agreegates of Media.
- The toString() method calls each of the individual toString methods of each class.
- The Media class should implement the interface.
- return -1 for m2 before, 1 for m1 before, 0 if order doesn't matter (i.e. both are equal)
- Yes, it should be possible
- Change if branches to arrive at required returns with new ordering rule
